# guitar-search
This repository contains files which host a project to search for used Seagull and Eastman guitars on Craigslist.

The project aims to do the following:

Minimum functionality:
1. searches "musical instruments" page of Craigslist for Seagull and Eastman guitars
2. filters for price and time since posting
3. populates daily file with guitars for sale and links to Craigslist page

Additional enhancements:
1. further refine search based on initial results (e.g. see what condition, see if electrified)
2. send email alert of new guitars
3. maintain singular file with historical record of guitars matching criteria and update records when applicable
4. send automated email to poster

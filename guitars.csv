Seagull Maritime CH SWS Acouctic Guitar,575,2021-08-15,2021-08-19,"Very nice Seagull Maritime CH SWS. The CH stands for 'concert hall', which is the body size. It is a 000 size guitar. The SWS stands for 'solid wood series'. The top is solid sitka spruce. The back and sides are solid mahogany. The neck is mahogany and the fingerboard is rosewood. It is essentially Seagull's version of a Martin 000-18. It is a very well made guitar and it sounds great. The finish is nitro lacquer, at least that's what their website said when I got it. I added the pick guard, which I cut by hand to a smaller version of a Martin shape. I also rubbed the body out by hand with three grades of polishing compound to a soft semigloss finish. It was originally a mat finish. This process really opened it up sonically. It looks better too, more luster. I also installed a bone saddle. The original was TUSQ. I guess you could say it has been customized. The action is light and fast because I am mostly a finger style player, but you can strum it too. It won't buzz. It has Seagull's 1.8"" nut size, so the neck is pretty wide, but not thick. It's a nice guitar, lightweight with really balanced tone and good sustain and quite responsive to all styles of playing, yet very sturdy in construction. This thing could probably take a lot of abuse before it needed any repairs. I have too many guitars right now and this one is seeing very little action. I had a Black Angel soundhole pickup in it for quite a while. I'm keeping the pickup because I love it. You can install your favorite pickup. It's already drilled for an endpin jack. The guitar is in excellent condition with no blemishes to speak of. I also installed a strap button near the endpin jack because I hate struggling with straps on fat endpin jacks. Treat yourself to a nice all solid wood guitar for very little money. No case, just the guitar. Thanks for looking. Reasonable offers considered.",https://richmond.craigslist.org/msg/d/richmond-seagull-maritime-ch-sws/7365983385.html

This is as close as it gets to an ES 175.  Has really good acoustic tone unlike other imitations out there.  It has some dings but plays very well and the frets are all good.  The pickup is a stacked P90.   Comes with a hardshell case.  Asking $475 OBO.",https://richmond.craigslist.org/msg/d/virginia-beach-eastman-ar-371-hollow/7367135867.html
